Document Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2025-03-26 01:00 UTC

 1. Project Overview

1.1. Project Goals:

The primary goal of the PolyMathPainter project is to create a system for generating abstract art using mathematical equations and computational functions. The system should allow for layering multiple generative techniques, providing a flexible and expressive platform for artistic exploration. The project emphasizes code quality, modularity, and resource efficiency. The end goal is to produce aesthetically pleasing and visually complex artworks.

1.2. Target Audience:

This project is designed for users with limited programming experience but a foundational understanding of art and design concepts. The codebase should be easily understandable and extensible.

1.3. Key Features:

*   Layered Abstraction: The system supports layering multiple generative techniques to create complex visual compositions.
*   Mathematical Foundations: Art generation is driven by mathematical functions and equations, providing precise control over visual elements.
*   Modular Design: The codebase is organized into well-defined modules for maintainability and reusability.
*   Interactive Exploration: The system will include a user interface for interactively exploring different parameters and techniques.
*   Resource Efficiency: Algorithms and techniques are chosen to minimize computational cost and memory usage.

 2. System Architecture

2.1. High-Level Architecture:

The system follows a layered architecture:

1.  Mathematical Functions Layer: This layer provides a library of mathematical functions and algorithms used for generating visual elements (e.g., fractals, noise, polynomials).
2.  Art Generators Layer: This layer uses the mathematical functions to generate specific visual elements, such as shapes, colors, and textures.
3.  Layer Compositing Layer: This layer combines multiple art generators into a single composition using blending modes and other compositing techniques.
4.  User Interface Layer: This layer provides a user interface for controlling the parameters of the art generators and the compositing process.

2.2. Component Diagram:

    B --> C(Art Generator 1);
    B --> D(Art Generator 2);
    C --> E(Math Functions);
    D --> E;
    E --> F[Output Image];
```

2.3. Module Structure:

The codebase is organized into the following modules:

*   `src/`: Contains all source code.
    *   `math_functions/`: Modules for mathematical computations (fractals.py, noise.py, polynomials.py, etc.). Each file contains a class.
    *   `art_generators/`: Modules for generating visual elements based on math functions (shape_generators.py, color_palettes.py, etc.). Each file contains a class.
    *   `layering/`: Modules for compositing and blending layers (compositor.py, blending_modes.py). Each file contains a class.
    *   `ui/`: Modules for the user interface (app.py, components.py). Each file contains a class for UI portions.
    *   `utils/`: Utility functions (file_management.py, config_loader.py). Each file contains a function.
*   `data/`: Stores generated data (images, configurations).  An empty `.gitkeep` file should exist to track this directory.
*   `output/`: Stores output images. An empty `.gitkeep` file should exist to track this directory.
*   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
*   `environment.yml`: Anaconda environment definition (generated using `conda env export > environment.yml`).
*   `README.md`: Project documentation.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

        self.max_iter = max_iter
        self.zoom_start = zoom_start
        self.x_start = x_start
        self.y_start = y_start

    def mandelbrot(self, width, height, x_start=-0.5, y_start=0, zoom=1):
        """

            height (int): Height of the image in pixels.
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: A 2D array representing the Mandelbrot set.
        """
        image = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.uint8)
        pixel_size = zoom / width
        x_range = np.linspace(x_start - (width/2) * pixel_size, x_start + (width/2) * pixel_size, width)
        y_range = np.linspace(y_start - (height/2) * pixel_size, y_start + (height/2) * pixel_size, height)

        for x in range(width):
            for y in range(height):
                c = complex(x_range[x], y_range[y])
                z = 0 + 0j
                for i in range(self.max_iter):
                    z = z * z + c
                    if abs(z) > 2:
                        image[y, x] = int(i / self.max_iter * 255)
                        break
        return image

 5. Current Status and Next Steps

5.1. Current Status:

*   The basic project structure is in place.
*   The `math_functions` module contains a basic `FractalGenerator` class with a `mandelbrot` function.
*   The `.gitignore` file has been created.
*   Anaconda environment file has been generated.

5.2. Next Steps:

1.  Implement additional mathematical functions in the `math_functions` module (e.g., Perlin noise, L-systems).
2.  Develop art generators in the `art_generators` module that utilize the mathematical functions to create visual elements.
3.  Implement the layer compositing logic in the `layering` module.
4.  Design and implement the user interface using Dash and Bootstrap.
5.  Add unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

 6. Outstanding Issues and Considerations

*   Resource Optimization: Explore techniques for optimizing the performance of the art generation algorithms (e.g., using Numba for JIT compilation).
*   User Interface Design: Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily explore different parameters and techniques.
*   Scalability: Consider the scalability of the system as the number of layers and art generators increases.
*   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent the system from crashing due to invalid input or unexpected conditions.
*   Versioning: Establish a clear versioning scheme for the project.
